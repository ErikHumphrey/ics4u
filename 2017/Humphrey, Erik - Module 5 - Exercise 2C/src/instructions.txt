Create an Assign application that reads and then displays the contents of a file containing
instructions for this assignment. Use Notepad or some other word processor to create the file.
Be sure that the file is saved as a Text file (TXT). The Assign application will need to include
the correct path to the location of the file. If a path is not specified, the file must be placed in
the same folder as the Assignment executable file.
