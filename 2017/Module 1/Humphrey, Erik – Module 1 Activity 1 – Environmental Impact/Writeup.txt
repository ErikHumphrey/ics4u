Part A:

The technology gap between the rich and poor is an eternal conflict
that predates more modern technology like personal computers.
The world is only improving, but access to digital supplies is still
sparse in even the most developed of countries. Moreover, limited access
to the Internet puts those with insufficient technology at a disadvantage.
Useful as a teaching aid and a great way to learn, it is a big expense for
small schools and virtually part of one’s cost of living. In Canada, the
CRTC has begun an initiative to make internet packages and pricing more
affordable to ordinary citizens, reaching out to citizens with surveys
for feedback on the system as it exists today. While the cost of hardware
always decreases, it might be a decade before a pittance buys more than a
seemingly third-world internet connection.

Part B:

The City of Ottawa’s “Take it Back!” program makes it easy for citizens to
get rid of household waste. By making disposal of recyclables and garbage
feel convenient, the initiative allows residents to give car parts, computer parts,
cell phones, hazardous items like medical syringes, and other day-to-day articles
back to nonprofit organizations and businesses who can reuse the leftover materials
in the products that they sell. Through a partnership with charities and retailers,
the program keeps 500 tonnes of refuse out of landfills each year.
